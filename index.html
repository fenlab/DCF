									<b>Mission</b> </br>
									Under the direction of Dr. Katrina Fenlon, the DCF Program is a partnership with the National Agricultural Libary (NAL) to provide students with research and practical experience solving 
									real-world digital curation challenges. Digital Curation fellows have contributed to numerous research initiatives during this program's several-year history, including: </br>
									• addressing gaps in NAL's archives and digital curation capacity through rigorously developed digital preservation plans and evaluations</br>
									• researching user experience to improve the outreach and impact of digital collections</br>
									• conducting systemic evaluations of metadata quality, diversity, and equity of representation in digtial collections, as well as software platforms for data repositories</br>
									• building new web archives and digital collections, conducting physical arhival processing, and creating collection development policies</br>
									• evaluating predatory publishers and indexing journals for the AGRICOLA database</br>
									• leveraging visualization and machine learning techniques to create dashboards for analytics and impact data, including a new data dashboard for ARS researchon coronavirus.</br>
